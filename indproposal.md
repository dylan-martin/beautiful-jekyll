# Motivation

The college search process is an expensive and time-consuming, factors which can often prove prohibitive for potential college applicants.  Even when high schoolers are able to thoroughly research colleges and visit potential schools, it can be almost impossible to sort through the information provided and understand which school best suits their interests.  Admissions Offices, while crucial to the application process, often only offer a generic image of the school that gives little idea of what student life is really like.  Further, many of the best resources for learning about a college are only available to those candidates who can make it to campus.  Be it monetary restrictions, distance, or simple lack of genuine information, finding the right college is a difficult task.

I want to improve this process by moving the college search process into the wild, facilitating interpersonal discussions that both dig deeper than Admissions Office spiels and make the information accessible to a broad range of people.
