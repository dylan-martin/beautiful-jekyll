![Image of Shower Control](good_design.png)

This shower control (in my off-campus house) intuitively communicates its functionality to the user without the need for extra information or prior knoweledge.  Assuming that the user has a basic understanding of how showers work, the simple signifiers on the control effectively and quickly demonstrate how to operate the shower.  The dial itself, with its circular shape and vertically oriented handle,  clearly indicates that the user should rotate the handle to control the device. The asymetric orientation of the handle additionally indicates that the longer side of the handle should be considered when adjusting the shower.  Further, the small arrows again indicate ciruclar motion.  The words along the control clearly indicate the effect of turning the dial in different directions, with leftward motion making the shower colder and rightward motion making it hotter.  Finally, the "Off" label, clearly indicates which position of the handle will turn the water off.  These signifiers are simple and unintrusive, indicating the functions of the dial in an unconfusing way.  Aesthetically, the control is unobtrusive and does not occupy unneccessary space in the shower.  The design of this control makes it easy to use without providing any unnecessary or intrusive features.
